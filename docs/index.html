        <span id="aboutMeTxt">About Me</span>
        I am a passionate and driven student currently pursuing my path to become a Full Stack Developer and AI <br>
        Engineer. With a strong foundation in programming and problem-solving, I am dedicated to building<br>
        innovative, efficient, and impactful solutions that merge technology with real-world applications.<br>
        <br>

        Beyond personal growth, I aspire to serve a greater purpose by contributing my skills as part of the IT<br>
        personnel in the Armed Forces or Government sector. My vision is to leverage advanced technologies—<br>
        such as web development, artificial intelligence, and data-driven systems—to strengthen digital<br>
        infrastructures, enhance security, and support nation-building.<br>
        <br>

        I thrive on continuous learning, adaptability, and collaboration. Whether developing scalable applications,<br>
        exploring machine learning models, or contributing to mission-critical systems, I am committed to using<br>
        technology as a tool for both innovation and service.<br>
